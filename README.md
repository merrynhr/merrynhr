## Merryn Hurley-Rawlins

I'm an enthusiastic full stack developer and former teacher with a strong interest in Ruby on Rails. I've worked with JS frameworks like React, React Native, and Vue. In September 2020, I left my teaching job in Jakarta to focus on programming. Initially introduced to programming for statistics at university, my interest in e-learning and web development grew during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading me to return to the UK to pursue this career.

My interest in education helped motivate my own learning and led me to Makers Academy, a highly selective bootcamp with a focus on Ruby and JavaScript. Makers encouraged the use of Test Driven Development to produce DRY, well organized code, and a methodical step by step process that has helped inform my approach to programming.  For our final project, my team built a tutoring platform, reflecting our interest in education. I suggested using a Rails API on the backend and React on the frontend. By testing our Rails API with Postman and Insomnia, we successfully executed the project in under two weeks.

After graduating from Makers, I joined the frontend team at Global Initiative, an Oxford digital agency, for work experience. Over two weeks, I converted Blade templates into Vue.js components for a Laravel project. Despite no prior Laravel or PHP experience, I applied MVC design principles from Rails to succeed. This role also introduced me to efficient project management technologies like Liquid Planner and Jenkins for continuous integration.

After my internship, I freelanced with a small team to develop Acknowledge, a React Native app focused on mental health. Working in an informal setting required personal drive to maintain progress. Balancing job hunting and work on this project demanded strong time management and organizational skills.

Building on my previous experience, I took on a full stack Ruby on Rails Developer role at mmtm (April 2022 to July 2024), helping me transition from a junior to a confident mid-level developer. I led projects focusing on API integration and user experience, managed client support, and conducted workshops to gather requirements. As a sprint lead, I handled sprint planning, database design, user story writing, and UI/UX design. Additionally, I integrated Vue and Vuex components into Rails applications and carried out maintenance tasks, such as upgrading apps to Rails 7.
